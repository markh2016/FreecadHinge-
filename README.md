# Freecad Hinge

Design your own hinges for just about anything you need  to do 

I  a design I put together today to show  all how you can  take open source and put this to real advantage 
with reating your own work  in mind  and with ability to  design from home where ever that may be  or where evere you are 
Ive also  found out how to animate this  so that you can see the  opening and closing action of the hinge  itself 
Hope this inspires a few more people  with this in mind 

In the meantime enjoy  fell free to downlaod  and experiment with this 

Thanking you Mark Harrington
